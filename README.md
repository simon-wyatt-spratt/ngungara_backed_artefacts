Abstract: The identification of standardised tools in the archaeological record is one of the key methods by which archaeologists recognise behavioural patterns in the past. In Australia, one of the most preeminent standardised tools is the mid-late Holocene backed artefact. To better understand this  standardisation, we examine a large assemblage of backed artefacts from Weereewaa/Lake Ngungara (Lake George), in Southeastern Australia, which has both locally manufactured and imported backed artefacts. These local and imported artefacts are found side-by-side within well-bounded stone artefact concentrations. Across this landscape two shapes are present: backed points  and geometric artefacts. Their distribution is not uniform; rather similarly shaped local and imported backed artefacts are concentrated in defined areas. We test whether this pattern results from the removal of spent inserts from hafts and their replacement by similarly shaped, locally manufactured artefacts. We also test whether raw material has a structuring influence on the shape of these artefacts.
